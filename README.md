## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to shed light on the current foreclosure situation in Los Angeles and how it contributes to the wealth gap and social inequality. The project aims to identify the communities struggling the most with foreclosures and the communities trending towards a much higher foreclosure rate. By doing so, it can help policymakers and lawmakers make better-informed decisions when passing legislation to address the problem.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide insights into the foreclosure rates in Los Angeles and identify possible external variables that could be correlated with foreclosure rates. The insights generated from this project can be used to help policy and lawmakers make better-informed decisions when passing legislation to address the foreclosure problem and social inequality.

## Datasets
This project uses two datasets:

- Foreclosed Property in Los Angeles from 2014 to 2019: This dataset details all registered foreclosed properties in Los Angeles from 2014 to 2019, retrieved from the Los Angeles Housing Department. : https://data.lacity.org/Housing-and-Real-Estate/2019-Registered-Foreclosure-Properties/rsxb-x48z
- Crime Data from 2010 to 2019: This dataset contains all incidents of crime that occurred in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2019. : https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z

## Methodology
The project follows the following methodology:

- Preprocessing of datasets to create a rich dataset for statistical analysis.
- Visualization of variables in the foreclosed property dataset to create a frequency map that represents the frequency of foreclosure rates in each zip code.
- Building an Emulated Distributed File System (EDFS) using MySQL-based emulation.
- Implementation of Partition-Based Map and Reduce (PMR) to perform search and analytics functions.
- Creation of an app for search and analytics functions.

## Results
The project generates several insights into the foreclosure rates in Los Angeles and identifies external variables that could be correlated with foreclosure rates. The insights generated can be used to help policy and lawmakers make better-informed decisions when passing legislation to address the foreclosure problem and social inequality.
